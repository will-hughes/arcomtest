<xpage:title>Topics</xpage:title>
    <xpage:body>
        <div>
            <p>This section explains the main Topic headings in the taxonomy, with examples of what lies beneath them.</p>
            <p>Topics represent practical problems faced by practitioners and researchers in construction management. They indicate the kinds of issues research seeks to address. As the industry evolves, this list can be updated to reflect emerging concerns. The taxonomy is based on the problems addressed in the research papers in this database, rather than an abstract model of knowledge. The aim is to reflect the world as it is, rather than as it might ideally be. These categories are still developing, and feedback from users will make them more useful over time.</p>
            <p>For presentation purposes, the Topics are separated into Policy, Strategy, Tactics, and Operations. These high-level groupings are only illustrative and are not used in the taxonomic processes.</p>

        <h3>Ideas, Suggestions, Criticisms</h3>
        <p>Please make suggestions, share your ideas and critique these classifications. They are far from perfect and, perhaps, rather clumsy in places. Bear in mind that this is only offered as a prototype. The idea is that it will prompt constructive suggestions and offers of help to work on a more nuanced and effective approach. The hope is that the structure offers a good scaffolding for more effective categories that are appropriate to the aims.</p>
